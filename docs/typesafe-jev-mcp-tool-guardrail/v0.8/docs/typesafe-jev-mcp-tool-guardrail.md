# TypeSafe Jev MCP Tool Guardrail

## Overview

The TypeSafe Jev MCP Tool Guardrail policy screens MCP `tools/call` requests using [TypeSafe AI's Jev](https://typesafe.ai/) "System One" model before they reach the MCP server. Jev doesn't generate text: it takes a state and a battery of typed questions, and returns calibrated structured answers. A `noul` question returns a yes/no probability, a `score` question returns a position on a scale you define, and a `choice` question returns a probability for each option you define.

For each screened tool call, the policy sends Jev a JSON state holding the tool name, its arguments and the scope from the matching [tool rule](#tool-rules), a plain description of what the agent is for:

```json
{
  "tool": { "name": "run_sql", "arguments": { "query": "DROP TABLE users;" } },
  "scope": "A customer support assistant that looks up orders and answers product questions."
}
```

If any question's answer reaches its threshold, the call is blocked with a JSON-RPC error. A `score` question with a `confidenceThreshold` blocks only when Jev's confidence also reaches it; a less confident answer is only recorded. In monitor mode, the policy only records that it would have blocked.

Use this policy alongside `mcp-acl-list` and `mcp-authz`. Those decide which tools a client may call by name and scope; this policy judges what a particular call would do. For example, `run_sql` may be allowed, but `run_sql` with `DROP TABLE users;` can still be blocked.

## Features

- Screens `tools/call` requests only; every other MCP method, notification and response passes through without calling Jev
- Tool rules set everything per tool: which tools are screened, the scope, the questions, the mode and fail-open; name one tool, or use `*` for every tool without its own rule
- Default questions covering destructive, irreversible, data-exfiltrating, secret-reading, privilege-raising, disruptive, security-weakening and out-of-scope calls; the destructive, irreversible, privilege and disruption questions don't flag effects the scope calls for
- The default questions are pre-filled in each new rule, so they can be seen and edited
- Configurable battery of typed questions (`noul`, `score`, `choice`) that can refer to `tool.name`, `tool.arguments` and `scope`
- Blocks with a JSON-RPC error that echoes the request `id` and `Mcp-Session-Id`, framed as a server-sent event when the request was sent with `Content-Type: text/event-stream`
- Rejects request bodies that can't be read unambiguously (invalid JSON, batches, duplicate or case-variant members), so a body can't be crafted to screen different arguments from the ones the MCP server runs
- `enforce` mode (blocks) or `monitor` mode (records hits without blocking, for tuning thresholds on real traffic), per rule
- Configurable Jev timeout (default `5s`) with one automatic retry when Jev is rate limited or overloaded
- Fail-closed by default on Jev API errors and timeouts; configurable to fail-open per rule
- Records Jev token usage and flagged questions in request metadata

## Configuration

The policy uses a two-level configuration: system parameters that hold your TypeSafe API credential, and per-proxy user parameters that control screening behaviour.

### System Parameters (From config.toml)

These parameters are set at the gateway level and are shared with the other TypeSafe Jev policies. Individual policy attachments can override them when needed.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `apiKey` | string | Yes | — | TypeSafe AI API key (https://typesafe.ai). |
| `baseURL` | string (URI) | No | `https://api.typesafe.ai` | Override the Jev API base URL. For testing only. |
| `model` | string | No | `jev-latest` | Jev model identifier. |

#### Sample System Configuration

Add the following entries to your `config.toml` file. They must be at the top level of the file, before any `[section]` header:

```toml
jev_apikey = ""
jev_base_url = "https://api.typesafe.ai"
jev_model = "jev-latest"
```

### User Parameters (API Definition)

In the AI Workspace, this policy can be configured with a guided form, defined in the `x-wso2-policy-ui` block of its policy definition. A new rule comes with `*`, `enforce` and the default questions filled in, the scale and options fields appear only for the question types that use them, and invalid values are flagged before saving. The parameters are the same either way.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `tools` | array of objects | Yes | — | Which tools to screen, and how; see [Tool rules](#tool-rules). At least one rule. |
| `timeout` | string (Go duration) | No | `5s` | Maximum time to wait for Jev, for example `"5s"` or `"1500ms"`, up to `"30s"`. Includes one retry when Jev returns `429` (rate limited) or `529` (overloaded). A timeout is handled per the matching rule's `passthroughOnError`. |
| `showAssessment` | boolean | No | `false` | When `true`, the JSON-RPC error for a blocked call includes, in `error.data`, which questions were flagged, their values, and thresholds. |

`scope`, `questions`, `mode` and `passthroughOnError` are set in each rule. At the top level they are rejected, so a setting can't be silently ignored.

#### Question object shape

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|--------------|
| `key` | string | Yes | Unique identifier for this question, echoed in the assessment. |
| `type` | `noul` \| `score` \| `choice` | Yes | `noul` returns a calibrated 0–1 probability. `score` returns a position on `criteria`. `choice` returns a probability for each option in `criteria`. |
| `instructions` | string | Yes | The question to ask Jev. Refer to parts of the state in backticks, for example `` `tool.arguments` `` or `` `scope` ``. |
| `criteria` | array of strings | Required for `score` and `choice` | For `score`: 2–10 ordered scale descriptions, lowest first. For `choice`: 2–255 options; add an `other` option when the list might not cover every call. |
| `blockOn` | array of strings | Required for `choice` | The `criteria` options that count towards blocking. |
| `threshold` | number | Yes | For `noul`: minimum probability (0–1) to block. For `score`: minimum scale position to block. For `choice`: minimum combined probability (0–1) of the `blockOn` options to block. |
| `confidenceThreshold` | number | No (`score` only) | Minimum confidence (0–1) Jev must report for a `score` at or above `threshold` to block. A less confident answer doesn't block; it is recorded in request metadata under `typesafe-jev-mcp-tool-guardrail:low-confidence`. |

#### Default questions

Each rule's `questions` is pre-filled with these `noul` questions, each blocking at `0.7`, so they can be seen and edited in the policy configuration. If a rule's `questions` is omitted or empty, the same questions are used.

| Key | Instructions |
|-----|--------------|
| `destructive` | Would running the tool call in `tool` destroy, overwrite, or damage data, files, or systems that cannot easily be recreated, in a way that `scope` does not call for? |
| `irreversible` | Would running the tool call in `tool` have an effect that cannot be undone, such as sending a message, moving money, or publishing something, that `scope` does not call for? |
| `exfiltration` | Would running the tool call in `tool` send secrets, credentials, or private data outside the organisation? |
| `sensitive_data` | Would running the tool call in `tool` read or reveal secrets, credentials, or payment card data? |
| `privilege` | Would running the tool call in `tool` grant or raise access rights or permissions in a way that `scope` does not call for? |
| `disruption` | Would running the tool call in `tool` stop, shut down, or take offline a running service or system in a way that `scope` does not call for? |
| `security_control` | Would running the tool call in `tool` turn off or weaken a security control, such as multi-factor authentication, a firewall, encryption, or audit logging? |
| `out_of_scope` | Is the tool call in `tool` unrelated to the purpose described in `scope`? |

The questions that mention `scope` keep the guardrail from blocking the work the agent exists to do, such as a support assistant replying to a customer or issuing a refund within its limit, while still flagging calls outside that job. This is why every tool rule needs a `scope`: without one, these questions have nothing to compare against.

#### Tool rules

The `tools` parameter chooses which tools are screened and how. Each rule names one tool, exactly as it appears in `tools/call` (`params.name`), or `*` for every tool without its own rule. MCP proxies take policies for the whole proxy, so this list is how the policy is set up per tool, as in `mcp-authz`.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Yes | `*`, pre-filled | The tool name, or `*`. Each name, `*` included, can have one rule. |
| `scope` | string | Yes | — | What the agent is meant to do, in plain words; see [Writing a scope](#writing-a-scope). |
| `questions` | array of objects | No | The [default questions](#default-questions), pre-filled | The typed questions to ask Jev about this rule's tool calls; see [Question object shape](#question-object-shape). The call is blocked if any question's answer is at or above its threshold; a `score` question with a `confidenceThreshold` also needs Jev's confidence to reach it, and is otherwise only recorded. |
| `mode` | `enforce` \| `monitor` | No | `enforce`, pre-filled | `enforce` blocks when a question crosses its threshold. `monitor` never blocks; see [Monitor mode](#monitor-mode). |
| `passthroughOnError` | boolean | No | `false` | When `true`, lets this rule's calls through if the Jev API call fails or times out (fail-open). When `false`, the call is rejected with a JSON-RPC internal error (fail-closed). |

How a call is matched:

- A rule for the exact tool name wins over `*`. Only one rule applies to a call, so each screened call is one Jev request, with that rule's scope, questions, mode and `passthroughOnError`.
- A tool that no rule matches isn't screened and passes through without calling Jev. Without a `*` rule, only the listed tools are checked, and tools added to the MCP server later aren't checked until they get a rule.
- A rule doesn't inherit anything from the `*` rule. For example, a custom question added to `*` doesn't apply to a tool with its own rule; add it there too.

To screen every tool, use one `*` rule:

```yaml
params:
  tools:
    - name: "*"
      scope: "A calculator assistant that adds numbers and echoes short messages back to the user."
```

To screen every tool, but judge one of them against a different scope, or monitor it instead of blocking, add a rule for it:

```yaml
params:
  tools:
    - name: "*"
      scope: "A calculator assistant that adds numbers and echoes short messages back to the user."
    - name: orderPizza
      scope: "A pizza ordering assistant that places pizza orders for the customer."
      mode: monitor
```

To screen only some tools, leave out the `*` rule:

```yaml
params:
  tools:
    - name: orderPizza
      scope: "A pizza ordering assistant that places pizza orders for the customer."
```

Here only `orderPizza` calls are sent to Jev; every other tool call goes straight to the MCP server.

##### Writing a scope

The scope is sent to Jev as `scope`. The default `destructive`, `irreversible`, `privilege` and `disruption` questions ignore effects the scope calls for, and `out_of_scope` flags calls outside it. `exfiltration`, `sensitive_data` and `security_control` don't mention the scope, but Jev still sees it, so a job that clearly involves that data can lower their answers too: a raw card number passed to `orderPizza` was flagged under "A calculator and pizza ordering assistant…", but not under "A pizza ordering assistant that places pizza orders for the customer.".

Describe the job rather than giving instructions: "A calculator and pizza ordering assistant that adds numbers and places pizza orders" works, while "A calculator assistant; allow pizza ordering" doesn't, because Jev judges whether each call fits the job described.

#### What is screened

- **Screened:** a `POST` to the proxy's `/mcp` endpoint whose JSON-RPC `method` is `tools/call`. The policy reads `params.name` and `params.arguments` from the request body, on every MCP protocol version.
- **Passed through without calling Jev:** a `tools/call` for a tool no [tool rule](#tool-rules) matches, every other method (`initialize`, `tools/list`, `resources/read`, and so on), notifications, JSON-RPC responses sent by the client, and requests to other paths.
- **Rejected before calling Jev:** request bodies the policy can't read unambiguously, since the MCP server might read them differently. This happens before the tool rules are matched, so a body can't name one tool to the policy and another to the MCP server:

| Case | HTTP status | JSON-RPC code |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Invalid JSON | `400` | `-32700` |
| Not a single JSON-RPC object (for example a batch array, or an event-stream body with more than one event) | `400` | `-32600` |
| Duplicate or case-variant `id`, `method`, `params`, `name` or `arguments` member | `400` | `-32600` |
| `params` missing or not an object, tool name missing, or `arguments` not an object | `400` | `-32602` |

#### Block response

A blocked call gets HTTP `400` with a JSON-RPC error, the same status and code `mcp-acl-list` uses for a denied tool:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 7,
  "error": {
    "code": -32000,
    "message": "MCP tool call blocked by guardrail"
  }
}
```

With `showAssessment: true`, `error.data` carries the details:

```json
"data": {
  "interveningGuardrail": "TypesafeJevMcpToolGuardrail",
  "assessments": [
    { "question": "destructive", "type": "noul", "threshold": 0.7, "value": 0.98 }
  ]
}
```

When the check itself fails (a Jev error, timeout, or incomplete answer) and the policy fails closed, the call gets HTTP `503` with JSON-RPC code `-32603` and the message `MCP tool call could not be checked by guardrail`.

Every error response echoes the `Mcp-Session-Id` header, and the request `id` when the policy could read it; a body rejected as invalid JSON, not a single object, or with an ambiguous `id` gets `"id": null`. If the request was sent with `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, the error is framed as a single server-sent event.

#### Monitor mode

With `mode: monitor` on a rule, the policy never blocks that rule's calls. A call that would have been blocked is let through, the hit is recorded in analytics (`isGuardrailHit`, `guardrailName`), and the flagged questions are written to request metadata under `typesafe-jev-mcp-tool-guardrail:assessments`. Use it to tune thresholds and wording on real traffic before enforcing.

#### Request metadata

In both modes the policy writes Jev's token usage to `typesafe-jev-mcp-tool-guardrail:usage` as `{"input_tokens": ..., "output_tokens": ...}`, alongside any flagged questions as described above.

#### Limitations

- **The MCP proxy doesn't see the agent's conversation.** Scope is judged against the configured `scope` text, not against what the user asked for.
- **Tools without a rule aren't screened.** Without a `*` rule, a tool added to the MCP server later isn't checked until it gets a rule.
- **Jev judges what the arguments say.** Tool descriptions aren't part of a `tools/call` request, so Jev sees only the name and arguments. For example, an `echo` tool asked to repeat the text "rm -rf /" can be flagged as destructive.
- **Arguments are untrusted input.** Adversarial text inside arguments can influence Jev's answers ([jev-1.13 known weaknesses](https://docs.typesafe.ai/model-jaggedness/jev-1.13)). Keep `mcp-acl-list` and `mcp-authz` in place for rules that must always hold.
- **Latency.** Each tool call waits for one Jev request, bounded by `timeout`.
- **Size.** Jev accepts up to 32k tokens of state within 64k tokens per request ([models](https://docs.typesafe.ai/models)). A larger call fails the check and is handled per the matching rule's `passthroughOnError`.

#### Policy order

Place this policy after `mcp-spec-validation`, `mcp-auth` and `mcp-authz` in the proxy's policy list, so malformed and unauthorised requests are rejected before a Jev request is made.

#### build.yaml Integration

Inside the `api-platform` repository, add the policy package under `policies:` in `/gateway/build.yaml`:

```yaml
- name: typesafe-jev-mcp-tool-guardrail
  gomodule: github.com/wso2/gateway-controllers/policies/typesafe-jev-mcp-tool-guardrail@v0
```

## Reference Scenarios

### Example 1: Screen Tool Calls with the Default Questions

Attach the policy to an MCP proxy with one `*` rule, to screen every tool with the default questions:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.api-platform.wso2.com/v1
kind: Mcp
metadata:
  name: support-tools-v1.0
spec:
  displayName: support-tools
  version: v1.0
  context: /support-tools
  upstream:
    url: https://mcp-backend:8080/mcp
  policies:
    - name: typesafe-jev-mcp-tool-guardrail
      version: v0
      params:
        tools:
          - name: "*"
            scope: "A customer support assistant that looks up orders and answers product questions."
```

A read-only call passes through to the MCP server:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/support-tools/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"get_order","arguments":{"order_id":"A-1042"}}}'
```

A destructive call is blocked:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/support-tools/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"run_sql","arguments":{"query":"DROP TABLE users;"}}}'
```

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"error":{"code":-32000,"message":"MCP tool call blocked by guardrail"}}
```

### Example 2: Custom Questions with Assessment Details

Replace the default questions with a risk scale and a destination check, and include the assessment in blocked responses:

```yaml
policies:
  - name: typesafe-jev-mcp-tool-guardrail
    version: v0
    params:
      showAssessment: true
      tools:
        - name: "*"
          scope: "A support assistant that looks up orders and replies to customers by email."
          questions:
            - key: risk
              type: score
              instructions: "What is the worst effect running the tool call in `tool` could have?"
              criteria:
                - "Reads data only."
                - "Changes data in a way that is easy to undo."
                - "Deletes or overwrites data."
                - "Has an effect outside the system that cannot be undone."
              threshold: 2
              confidenceThreshold: 0.6
            - key: external_destination
              type: noul
              instructions: "Does `tool.arguments` send data to a URL or email address outside example.com?"
              threshold: 0.7
```

### Example 3: Monitor Before Enforcing, Fail-Open on Outage

Run the default questions in monitor mode first, and let calls through if Jev is unavailable:

```yaml
policies:
  - name: typesafe-jev-mcp-tool-guardrail
    version: v0
    params:
      timeout: "2s"
      tools:
        - name: "*"
          scope: "A support assistant that looks up orders and replies to customers by email."
          mode: monitor
          passthroughOnError: true
```

Flagged calls are recorded in analytics and request metadata without being blocked. Once the thresholds look right on real traffic, set the rule's `mode` to `enforce`.
